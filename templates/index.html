                <p>At this time, research has not discovered any current tools on the marketplace for this specific type
                    of analysis. The key benefit here is the data reported by anonymized individuals, and not companies.
                    The information should be more trustworthy and accurate, which will lead to more accurate models and
                    more competitive salary offers. Some job posting websites are posting hiring ranges shared by
                    corporate recruiters, however those postings are not granular to the dollar level and can range by a
                    factor of tens of thousands of dollars. The suggestions that will be offered by this data product
                    are specific to a candidate, and a dollar amount. </p>

        <p>Analysis of the data set resulted in a few interesting observations. Some data visualization methods have
            been provided to depict the mthods of analysis for further exploration.</p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col col-6"><img src="../static/images/k-means-descriptive-analysis.png" class="img-fluid"
                                        alt="k-means clustering figure from data set"></div>
        </div>

        <p>The data set has been identified with over 12,000 records in the United States alone, which is sufficient to
            reliably train a model for accuracy. The data set is recent, being collected in 2020, which will enhance the
            validity of the end result by reflecting the current industry. The data set is in a format which is
            extremely usable by the intended toolset and is in a state which can quickly be imported and manipulated
            with relative ease. </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col col-6"><img src="../static/images/non-descriptive-analysis.png" class="img-fluid"

        </div>

        <p>Multiple non-descriptive estimators were assessed for this data set, and an Elastic Net predictive method was
            determined to provide the highest scoring model after training. This method performed well as a modified
            linear regression model when compared to other techniques on the same data set. The data was split with 80%
            assigned to train the model, and 20% reserved for testing of the model. </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col col-6"><img src="../static/images/education-level-analysis.png" class="img-fluid"

        </div>

        <p>The data exploration and inspection process was tailored to the data set. Data was isolated to be specific to
            the business case of software developers in the United States. The data was cleaned to be formatted in a
            state where there were no null values in the fields that were being analyzed for the machine learning model.
            This cleaned data was then visualized a number of ways, to inspect for possible trends or relationships. The
            entire approach was documented in the code and can be
            used in future enhancements or data exploration efforts. In addition, this code can be extended for future
            data sets to include a broader range of salary data on a global or multi-year scale.</p>
